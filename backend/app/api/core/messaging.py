# Placeholder for Kafka messaging functionality

# This function is expected to provide a Kafka producer instance.
# The actual implementation will depend on the Kafka library being used (e.g., confluent-kafka-python, kafka-python).
# It should be configured to connect to the Kafka broker using environment variables or configuration settings.
